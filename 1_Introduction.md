# Introduction  
  
## What is OPTIMIZATION ?  
>> The process of determining the best design  
>> Obtaining a valid, accurate model of the design problem is the most important step in optimization.  
>> Design variables : some variables which are free to be adjusted-whose value can be set.  
>> The number of design variables as the degrees of freedom of the computer model.  
>> The freedom we have to change the design variables leads to the concept of design space (we can search to find the best design).  
>> Design Functions consist of 2 items : Objectives and Constraints.  
>> Objectives and Constraints are criteria we wish to optimize. 
>> Objectives represents goals we wish to maximize or minimize.  
>> Constraints represent limits we must stay within, if inequality constraints, or, in the case of equality constraints, target value we must satisfy.  
>> A good computer-based analysis model will link to optimization software.  
>> Optimization methods are somewhat generic in nature in that many methods work for wide variety of problems.  
>> In summary, computer-based optimization refers to using computer algorithms to search the design space of a computer model. The design variables are adjusted bg an algorithm in order to achieve objectives and satisfy constraints. Many of these concepts will be explained in further detail in the following sections.
