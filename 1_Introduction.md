# Introduction  
  
## What is OPTIMIZATION ?  
>> The process of determining the best design  
>> Obtaining a valid, accurate model of the design problem is the most important step in optimization.  
>> Design variables : some variables which are free to be adjusted-whose value can be set.  
>> The number of design variables as the degrees of freedom of the computer model.  
>> The freedom we have to change the design variables leads to the concept of design space (we can search to find the best design).  
>> Design Functions consist of 2 items : Objectives and Constraints.  
>> Objectives and Constraints are criteria we wish to optimize. 
>> Objectives represents goals we wish to maximize or minimize.  
>> Constraints represent limits we must stay within, if inequality constraints, or, in the case of equality constraints, target value we must satisfy.  
>> A good computer-based analysis model will link to optimization software.  
>> Optimization methods are somewhat generic in nature in that many methods work for wide variety of problems.  
>> In summary, computer-based optimization refers to using computer algorithms to search the design space of a computer model. The design variables are adjusted bg an algorithm in order to achieve objectives and satisfy constraints. Many of these concepts will be explained in further detail in the following sections.   
   
  
## Engineering Models in Optimization  
>> Engineering models as analysis models.  
>> A Model requires some inputs in order to make calculations that are called analysis variables. 
>> Analysis variables include design variables (the variables we can change), material properties, boundary conditions, etc.  
>> The analysis model computes outputs called analysis functions.  
>> These functions represents what we need to determine the "goodness" of a design.   
  
## Models and Optimization by Trial-and-Error  
>> Determining how to improve the design is the job of the designer.  
>> To improve the design : specifies a set of inputs, evaluate the models, examines the output .... not satisfactory ....proposes a new set of inputs, evaluated, repeated many times.
