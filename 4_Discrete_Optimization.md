# Discrete Optimization  
  
One often encounters problems in which design variables must be selected from among a set of discrete values  
Examples of discrete variables include catalog or standard sizes (I beams, motors, springs, fasteners, pipes, etc.), materials, and variables which are naturally integers such as people, gear teeth, number of shells in a heat exchanger and number of distillation trays in a distillation column
Many engineering problems are discrete in nature.
